# This code allows me to select a stratified sample from the ILM adult butternuts based on health (both % girdle and % live canopy, in a 3x3 subgroup stratification for high, medium, and low health in both metrics independently.)
#After I generated a sample from this code, I then tested its representativeness of the pool of eligible adult butternuts in terms of spatial extent and crown class.
#I call the package dpylr to filter my data with its syntax
#I call one datasheet: ILM_assoc_trees, which is just a datasheet of all the ILM trees.  Alternatively, this can be run with the full datasheet.csv filtered by site == "ILM".
